				<p>A new and rising L.A. based female rapper, is one of the fresh faces in West Coast rap to watch for. Born in Lynwood, California she hails from a family of musicians. From an early age, friends and family of the artist believed she was destined to entertain. At the age of 14 she began recording as posture of a rap trio, Dime Divas Baddest. The group toured local venues throughout Southern California for two years before Shanice would eventually go on to become a solo artist.

				<p>However, her multi-genre fusions set her apart from the conventional rapper. Elements of rock, dub-step, pop, r&amp;b and dance can often be found in much of the music that identifies her unique style. Shanice demonstrates her versatility as she can often be found on the production side of music as well. She is not only the writer, but also the co-producer of her own music. She often collaborates in projects for other aspiring artists as well. As a multi-talented artist, writer and producer Shanice Ross is definitely an up and coming force to watch for.</p>
